# product-landing-page
This is my 3rd project that I have created on freeCodeCamp, here I am testing my HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills to complete this project. 
Plain CSS is recommended because that is what the lessons have covered so far and you should get some practice with plain CSS. 
You can use Bootstrap or SASS if you choose. Additional technologies (just for example jQuery, React, Angular, or Vue) are not recommended for this project,
and using them is at your own risk.
